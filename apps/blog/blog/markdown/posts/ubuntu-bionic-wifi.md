# Setup
This setup was done on an [Intel Nuc](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/boards-kits/nuc.html).

The Nuc is running Ubuntu Server 18.04 Bionic, CLI only. It has a wired
connection to a DHCP-enabled home router initially, but will use wireless
internet after this in finished


# Find and Start the Wireless Device
```bash
ip link
```
Mine was called `wlp2s0`. Start it:
```bash
ip link set dev wlp2s0 up
```

# Download & Install wireless software

Ubuntu server doesn't ship with the required packages to connect to WiFi.

From another Ubuntu server that **does** have internet, plug in a USB stick
and mount it. This example assumes it's mounted to /mnt.

I'm pretty sure that it can connect to WEP without this, and its just the
newer WPA2 networks that basically everyone is using that need this.

```bash
# Delete anything currently in the apt cache
apt-get clean

# building some temp package lists, drop them in ~ or wherever
cd ~

# use apt-rdepends to get the dependencies
apt-get install apt-rdepends

# find deps for wireless-tools
apt-rdepends wireless-tools 2>/dev/null | grep "Depends: " | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq > packages1
echo wireless-tools >> packages1

# find deps for wpasupplicant
apt-rdepends wpasupplicant 2>/dev/null | grep "Depends: " | awk '{print $2}' | sort | uniq > packages2
echo wpasupplicant >> packages2
cat packages1 packages2 | sort | uniq > packages

# download the debs
cd /var/cache/apt/archives
cat ~/packages | while read p; do echo $p; apt-get download $p; done

# Copy the files
mkdir -p /mnt/debs
cp /var/cache/apt/archives/*.deb /mnt/debs
umount /mnt
```

Now remove the USB drive from that system and plug it into the offiline one.

```bash
# mount the usb drive
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt

# move the files to your cache directory
cp /mnt/debs/* /var/cache/apt/archives/

# Install the packages
apt-get install wireless-tools wpasupplicant
```

# Scan for SSIDs
The `iwlist` command can also give you other information about the network if
you don't pipe its output to grep, but it's pretty verbose.
```bash
iwlist wlp2s0 scanning | grep -ie ssid
```


# Join the WiFi Network with Netplan
You can use various commands to interactively connect to the network, but I
want this connection to come up with the NUC. Netplan is the new tool used to
configure networks since Ubuntu's Bionic stable release. Here's the netplan
config I used. You can see the wired connection in there too, it doesn't need
to be there once this is finished.

Be sure to replace "`MySSID`" and "`My Password`" with your own.

`vi /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml`
```
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp0s25:
      dhcp4: yes
  wifis:
    wlp2s0:
      dhcp4: yes
      access-points:
        "MySSID":
          password: "My Password"
```

Then apply the changes.
```
netplan try
```

You should have an IP address now in `ifconfig`. For some reason I didn't get
one right away, so I forced the DHCP request like this:
```
dhclient wlp2s0 -v
```

After that, you can connect to the wireless IP and don't need the wired one.
