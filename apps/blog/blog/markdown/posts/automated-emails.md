I've found that it's pretty common that I need to send emails from my software.
At first it seems easy, there are well documented libraries out there. Pretty
soon though, your super critical outage notification email has wound up in the
SPAM filter.

In this project, I explore the tools available to send email alerts from your
automated systems and how to ensure those emails are trusted by their receiving
mail servers.

This will be an ongoing project that I intend to circle back to as time
permits.
