## About This Site

This here's my technology blog.

It's intended to serve a few purposes:

1. Help other people solve problems I've ran into, particularly ones that were
   hard to google.
   1. Save my notes in an easy to reference format
   1. Showcase the cool stuff I've worked with
   1. Encourage me to keep learning new things
