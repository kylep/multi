# Blog

NextJS powered SSG for http://kyle.pericak.com.

This blog was previously powered by [Python Pelican](https://getpelican.com/), and there was
nothing wrong with that, but I wanted to learn something new and modern. Plus I'd gone a few years without
writing to my blog so I figured a new framework might help motivate me.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
ls out/  # show the files that were made
```

## Launching dev server

### NPM-powered one
This is convenient, reloads fast, but may not be entirely accurate to the "real" output:
```bash
npm run dev
```
