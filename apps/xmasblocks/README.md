# xmasblocks

My parents have these wooden blocks they bring out every Christmas holidays.
They say "Merry Christmas", and "joyeux noel" if you turn them around.

Scrambling them into something funny is fun. Writing a tool to find the possibilities
ended up being an interesting puzzle due to the high permutation count.
