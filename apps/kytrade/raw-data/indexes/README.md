# Downloaded stock data

Ideally I'll get the data from the same place every time.

Indexes to track:

- S&P 500
- S&P Global 100
- Down Jones Global Titans 50
- S&P TSX 60
- Dow Jones Industrial Average
- Russel Top 200
- NASDAQ-100



## S&P 500
- Downloaded from https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/library-content/products/fund-data/etfs/us/holdings-daily-us-en-spy.xlsx
- which was found on https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy
- Had to remove some top rows first
