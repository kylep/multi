## To configure MetalLB, you must specify ONE of the following two
## options.
#
## existingConfigMap specifies the name of an externally-defined
## ConfigMap to use as the configuration. Helm will not manage the
## contents of this ConfigMap, it is your responsibility to create it.
#
# existingConfigMap: metallb-config
#
## configInline specifies MetalLB's configuration directly, in yaml
## format. When configInline is used, Helm manages MetalLB's
## configuration ConfigMap as part of the release, and
## existingConfigMap is ignored.
## Refer to https://metallb.universe.tf/configuration/ for
## available options.
