# Sample Apps

These applications were built simply to learn how to build them and serve no other
purpose.

## Static Site - Building a markdown based blog

- *ssg-00-static-base*: Minimal static site that accepts one markdown file and outputs
  an HTML file. Includes project initialization, dev env setup, and base template.
- *ssg-01-multi-page-site*: Go from rendering one file to having a navigable site that
  combines multiple markdown files and has a dynamically generated index page.
- *ssg-02-metadata-and-style*: Parsing front matter with the gray-matter library to
  permit custom metadata to be stored in the mardown, and adding a common header with
  basic CSS.
